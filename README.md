# oct_news_scraper
This project is part of an python course from ZTM, that I pass successfully.
With this script, the OCT news all-articles page will be scraped, and the new content will be send to an email with html style.

For running the code a .env file is necessary, together with an GMAIL account. The input has to be EMAIL_ADDRESS= and EMAIL_PASSWORD=.
Also a folder csv_file is necessary, as the code is storing the database at this location.

Execute the app by scraping_oct_news.py your@mail.com
