# oct_news_scraper
With this script, the OCT news all-articles page will be scraped, and send to an email as html content.

For running the code a .env file is necessary. The input has to be EMAIL_ADDRESS= and EMAIL_PASSWORD=.
Also a folder csv_file is necessary, as the code is storing the database at this location.

Execute the app by scraping_oct_news.py your@mail.com
